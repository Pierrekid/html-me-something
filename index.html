    <h2 class= "heading"> Return of the Red Devils</h2>
    <p>Manchester United return for their second run with Jose
        Mourinho to recapture the glory days of United. In recent years, 
        United have struggled to become the team they once were. However
        under Mourinho they have a groove and are primed to make a deep 
        run in the tournament. With Paul Pogba, Lukuka and DDG leading the charge, United
        have all the pieces to make a great champions league run.

        be looking to lift his team to glory. With a fully fit and eligible countinho, suarez and dembele as
        supporting cast, Barcelona are ready to take on their domesttic rivals (Real Madrid)

    <h2 class= "heading"> New look Ronaldo, and a new look Juve</h2>
    <p>Hard to call them an underdog, but Juventus pose a new kind
    of threat to contenders in this years Champions League. With the addition 
    of Ronaldo to their roster, Juventus just might have found the missing piece 
    to put them over the top. With the likes of Dybala and Cuadrado orchestrating,
    many believe Juventus pose the biggest threat to challenging for the title
over the rest of the group.
